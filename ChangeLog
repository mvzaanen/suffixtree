* [17jun2003] Added iterator classes (abstract_suffixtree_iterator and
* suffixtree_iterator), which allows for operations on the suffixtree
* without changing the interface of the suffixtree class hierarchy.
* [31mar2003] Tested the system using g++ 3.2.1 and ld 2.12.90.0.9.
* Templates still not work as they should. Hopefully g++ 3.3 or so
* will improve this. I have included the suffixtree_impl.cpp in
* suffixtree_impl.h for now.
* [19dec2002] First release (0.1 alpha).
